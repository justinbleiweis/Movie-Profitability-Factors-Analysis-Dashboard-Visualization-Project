• Using a Kaggle dataset, performed exploratory data analysis using Jupyter Notebook Python, pandas, numpy and 
sklearn clustering analysis for six major factors to understand impact on movie revenue, costs and ROI
• Constructed a dashboard through plotly dash to facilitate big data visualization and support findings for each factor
